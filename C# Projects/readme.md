# Area Calculation

Create a C# Console application and write the application that meets the following requirements.

Get the geometric shape to be processed from the user (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle etc.)
Get the edge information from the user according to the selected shape
Get the desired dimension to be calculated from the user (Perimeter, Area, Volume, etc.)
Return the result of the calculation in an understandable way.

# Sum of integer pairs

Write a console application that takes the sum of n integer binary numbers entered from the screen, prints the sum if the numbers are different from each other, and prints the square of the sum if the numbers are the same.

Example Input: 2 3 1 5 2 5 3 3 3

Output: 5 6 7 81

# Absolute Squaring

It looks at whether n numbers entered from the screen are less than or greater than 67. Write the console application that takes the sum of the differences of the smaller ones and the absolute squares of the differences and prints them on the screen.

Example: Input: 56 45 68 77

Output: 33 101

# Drawing a Circle

Circle Drawing
Write the application that draws a circle on the console according to the radius received from the user.

Points to be Considered:

Avoid code repetition
The application should be divided into classes and methods, following the Single Responsibility rule.

# Voting Application

When the application runs, the pre-defined categories should be listed for voting. Only users registered in the system can vote. During voting, the user's username should be requested first. If he/she is not registered in the system, he/she should be allowed to register and continue voting from where he/she left off. Categories can be determined optionally.

Some Example Categories: Movie Categories Tech Stack Categories Sports Categories

Finally, when finalizing the exercise, the Voting results should be shown both in numbers and percentages.

Techniques that should be used:

Categories can be used pre-defined.

# Barcode Generator/Reader

Generate a barcode using 3rd party barcode libraries and save it to a location on the client's computer. Then write a console application that can read the barcode.

Techniques to be used:

Console Application
Import 3rd Party Library
Write to File
